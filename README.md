‘Personally Identifiable Information (PII)’ is a legal term pertaining to information security environments. 
As Information technology has come a long way over the past few years, the value of PII becomes more important, and personal information could be easily and frequently leaked in various situations. And there are people who are still not well aware of personal information and are in situations where they leak PII in spite of theirselves.

In this app, you can easily learn how to distinguish PII data while finding and hiding PII in various hypothetical situations. (such as sending e-mails, posting on the Internet, etc)
